//Ignore this this is just the assignment prompt thingy:



         /*For this assignment, you will need to create a short Madlibs passage. A madlib is a word game which consists of one player prompting others for a list of words to substitute for blanks in a story before reading aloud.

You are creating a program that serves as a madlibs generator. You will write a short story, minimum of four sentences that will be interspersed with inputs from the user.

Assignment features:

Use of the scanner object
Use of string variables
Use of print statements
Use of comments to label sections of your code
Assignment requirements:

The madlibs story produced must be at least 4 sentences long.
You must have the user input at least 8 words. (These can be verbs, nouns, adjectives, etc.)
The story, outside of the random portions, should have some continuity. Don't write 4 unrelated sentences.
The user must input all their words before any portion of the story is presented to them.
Grading Notes:

You will be assessed on:
Completion of the above requirements
Your adherence to conventions/standards, such as:
Proper indentation
Good variable naming
such as userNoun1 versus a variable named a
following capitalization standards (camelCase)
Proper use of white space 
 

Stuck? Helpful hints:

The first thing you should do is set up the Scanner object:
Then, create String type variables to store the user input. Remember to give them relevant names.
Then, acquire the input from the user.
Do this as many times as needed
Then, print out the story, using the words provided by the user.
Remember to test your programs before submitting!!!

Programs that do not compile will receive a zero!
