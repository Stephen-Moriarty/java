# java
For java stuff I guess

So the MadLibs file was for a class and self explanatorily it was a madlibs where the user inputs words and it outputs some sentences that includes those words.

The second file in this "folder" is the Chinese java file and the only issue I had with it so far is that when the user trys to input something in Chinese the program does not display it correctly back **out** in Chinese.
